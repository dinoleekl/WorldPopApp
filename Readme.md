This small Shiny app shows the world population statistics depending on the user input.

Move the **Year** slider or change the type of **Population Statistics** and notice how the geographical distribution of the population statistics as well as its histogram changes.

If **Year>2015**, we can also choose the **Projection type** to estimate future population statstics.

**Mean** and **standard deviation** of the population statistics are automatically calculated
and shown in the title of the histogram.
